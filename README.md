# Mini CPU Project – Digital Logic 2110252  
**By: DigLoEiEi Group**  

## Overview  
This project is a **Single-Cycle Mini CPU** designed and implemented as part of the Digital Logic 2110252 course. The CPU processes instructions within one clock cycle using a state machine that transitions through four states: **Idle, Execute, Wait Result, and Show Output**.  

The project was developed and simulated using the [Digital logic simulator by hneemann](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).

## Features  
- **State Machine** – Controls instruction flow and processing.  
- **Accumulators & Registers** – Manage data during computation.  
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – Handles arithmetic and logic operations.  
- **Memory** – Uses Program RAM (pRAM) for instructions and Result RAM (rRAM) for output storage.  
- **Inputs/Outputs** – Supports program loading, external data (M, N), and displays results on 7-segment displays.

## Tools  
- **Simulator**: [Digital by hneemann](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)  
  - An intuitive tool for designing and simulating digital circuits.
